In order to run and start this game, the run button should be pressed when running the game on processing. From here, the Home Screen will display, and the screen can be navigated by either clicking the high scores button to view high scores, clicking the instructions button to view instructions, or clicking either easy, medium, or hard to begin the game at the specified difficulty. In order to move the ship around, the “a” key moves it to the left and the “d” key moves to the right. The “w” key shoots out a projectile up towards the descending aliens, and those projectiles can then eliminate aliens if they come in contact with them. The life count starts at 5 for easy difficulty, 3 for medium difficulty, and 1 for hard difficulty and if the ship is hit with any enemy projectiles, then a life is subtracted. Once lives are at 0, then the player loses and the game ends and an end screen is pulled up. The game can be restarted by pressing the clicking "r" once the game concludes and the player will return to the Home Screen. Additionally, if "e" is pressed after the game concludes, the game will close. If the aliens reach the bottom of the screen, the player will lose. To win, the player must eliminate all of the invading aliens which will cause a win message to appear on the screen. High scores are tracked and can be viewed for each difficulty level from the Home Screen.
