In order to run and start this game, the run button should be pressed when running the game on processing. In order to move the ship around, the “a” key moves it to the left and the “d” key moves to the right. The “w” key shoots out a projectile up towards the descending aliens, and those projectiles can then eliminate aliens if they come in contact with them. The life count starts at 3, and if the ship is hit with any enemy projectiles, then a life is subtracted. Once lives are at 0, then the player loses and the game ends and can be restarted by pressing the “r” key. Additionally if the aliens reach the bottom of the screen, the player also loses. To win, the player must eliminate all of the invading aliens which will cause a win message to appear on the screen.
